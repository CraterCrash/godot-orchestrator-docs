# Godot Orchestrator Documentation

This repository contains all the source files for the [Godot Orchestrator plug-in's](httsp://gihub.com/Vahera/godot-orchestrator) documentation, using Docusaurus.

## 🎨 Themes

The documentation is based on the Docusaurus classic theme with a number of customizations, including improved styles and components.

  * Links to external resources should use the `<ExternalLink href="...">text</ExternalLink>` component.
  * Rendering of images should use the `<Figure image="..." caption="..."></Figure>` component.
  * Two or more images, side-by-side should be wrapped using the `<Figures>...</Figures>` component.
